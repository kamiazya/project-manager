# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> **Note**: For ADR creation guidelines and workflow integration, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Project Manager system. ADRs document the significant architectural decisions made during development, including the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision.

## What are ADRs?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help preserve the reasoning behind architectural choices and provide future developers with the context needed to understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Format

All ADRs in this project follow a standardized format defined in [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md). Each ADR includes:

- **Status:** Current state of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context:** The circumstances that led to this decision
- **Decision:** The specific choice made and its rationale
- **Consequences:** Expected positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives:** Other options considered and why they were rejected
- **Related Decisions:** Links to other ADRs or documents
- **Scope:** Which parts of the system are affected
- **Implementation Notes:** Practical guidance for implementation
- **Tags:** Keywords for categorization and search

## Naming Convention

ADRs are named using the following pattern:
```
NNNN-short-decision-title.md
```

Where:
- `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0003)
- `short-decision-title` is a kebab-case summary of the decision
