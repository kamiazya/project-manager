# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> **Note**: For ADR creation guidelines and workflow integration, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Project Manager system. ADRs document the significant architectural decisions made during development, including the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision.

## What are ADRs?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help preserve the reasoning behind architectural choices and provide future developers with the context needed to understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Format

All ADRs in this project follow a standardized format defined in [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md). Each ADR includes:

- **Status:** Current state of the decision (Accepted, Superseded)
- **Context:** The circumstances that led to this decision
- **Decision:** The specific choice made and its rationale
- **Consequences:** Expected positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives:** Other options considered and why they were rejected
- **Related Decisions:** Links to other ADRs or documents
- **Scope:** Which parts of the system are affected
- **Implementation Notes:** Practical guidance for implementation
- **Tags:** Keywords for categorization and search

### Status Guidelines

**Background:** In a Git-managed environment, the traditional "Proposed" status creates ambiguity. When an ADR is committed to the repository, it implies that a decision to document the architecture has already been made. Therefore, we adopt a simplified status model:

**Status Values:**

- **Accepted**: The decision has been agreed upon and should be implemented. This is the initial status for all new ADRs.
- **Superseded by ADR-XXXX**: The decision has been replaced by another ADR. Include a reference to the new ADR.

**Important Principle: Separation of Decision and Implementation**

ADRs track architectural decisions, not implementation status. The lifecycle of a decision (Accepted → Superseded) is independent from the implementation lifecycle (planned → in-progress → completed → migrating → retired). Implementation status should be tracked through project management tools, not ADR statuses.

**Workflow:**

1. **Pre-ADR Discussion**: Architecture proposals are discussed in GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, or team meetings.
2. **ADR Creation**: Once a decision is reached, create an ADR with status "Accepted".
3. **Future Changes**: When a decision is replaced by a new one, update the status to "Superseded by ADR-XXXX" and create the new ADR.

This approach aligns with the original purpose of ADRs: to record decisions that have been made, not to propose new ones.

### ADR Lifecycle and Status Transitions

The following diagram illustrates the complete ADR lifecycle, including the pre-ADR discussion phase and status transitions:

    end note

    note left of Accepted
        All new ADRs start
        with "Accepted" status
    end note
```

**Phase Descriptions:**

1. **Pre-ADR Phase** (Outside Git Repository):
   - **Discussion**: Initial problem identification and exploration
   - **Proposal**: Concrete solution proposals are drafted
   - **Review**: Community evaluates proposals through various channels
   - **Consensus**: Agreement reached on the architectural decision

2. **ADR Management Phase** (In Git Repository):
   - **ADR Created**: Document created following the template
   - **Accepted**: Default status for all new ADRs
   - **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a new ADR

**Key Points:**

- The "Proposed" status is eliminated from the Git-managed ADR workflow
- All architectural proposals and discussions happen before ADR creation
- ADRs are created only after decisions are made
- Status transitions are one-way (no reverting to previous states)

## Naming Convention

ADRs are named using the following pattern:

```
NNNN-short-decision-title.md
```

Where:

- `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0003)
- `short-decision-title` is a kebab-case summary of the decision
