# AI Integration Context

## Overview

The AI Integration context manages the collaboration between human developers and AI assistants. It coordinates AI task assignment, design validation workflows, multi-AI collaboration, and maintains shared context across different AI systems.

## Context Responsibilities

### Primary Responsibilities
- AI assistant registration and capability management
- Task assignment and coordination for AI assistants
- Design proposal validation workflow orchestration
- Multi-AI collaboration and consensus building
- AI context generation and maintenance
- Language bridging and translation services
- AI session management and history tracking

### Key Business Rules
- Each AI assistant can only work on one task at a time
- Design proposals require validation before implementation
- AI context must be synchronized across all active assistants
- Validation results must be traceable to specific AI experts
- Language translation maintains semantic accuracy
- Resource usage should be monitored and reported (optional)
- Context generation should adapt to model constraints
- **MCP Protocol**: Mandatory for all AI integrations
- **Operation Risk Assessment**: All operations categorized by risk level (high/medium/low)
- **Destructive Operation Safeguards**: User confirmation required for high-risk operations
- **Co-authorship Tracking**: Record both AI agent and human instructor for all operations

5. Synthesize feedback
6. Generate validation report
7. Return result to Ticket Management

### Multi-AI Collaboration Workflow
1. Identify collaboration need
2. Select participating AI assistants
3. Establish shared context
4. Coordinate task distribution
5. Facilitate information exchange
6. Merge results
7. Resolve conflicts

## AI Integration Patterns

### Context Generation Strategy
- **Hierarchical Context**: Project → Epic → Ticket
- **Selective Inclusion**: Only relevant information
- **Context Sizing**: Optimized for AI model limits
- **Version Control**: Track context evolution
- **Resource Awareness**: Token usage tracking and optimization
- **Adaptive Compression**: Automatic context reduction when approaching limits
- **Priority-based Inclusion**: Most relevant content prioritized

### Expert Selection Algorithm
```
1. Analyze proposal characteristics
2. Identify required expertise domains
3. Check expert availability
4. Consider past performance metrics
5. Select optimal expert combination
6. Handle expert unavailability
```

### Consensus Building
- **Weighted Opinions**: Based on expert specialization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Structured debate format
- **Final Decision**: Synthesized recommendation
- **Minority Reports**: Preserve dissenting opinions
