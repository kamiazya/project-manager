# Ticket Management Context

## Overview

The Ticket Management context is the core bounded context of the Project Manager system. It handles the creation, organization, and lifecycle management of development work through projects, tickets, and epics.

## Context Responsibilities

### Primary Responsibilities
- Project creation and configuration management
- Ticket lifecycle management (creation, updates, completion)
- Epic planning and progress tracking
- Dependency management between tickets
- Implementation plan documentation
- User management and permissions

### Key Business Rules
- Each ticket belongs to exactly one project
- Tickets can optionally belong to one epic
- Only one ticket per assignee can be in_progress at a time
- Tickets with unmet dependencies cannot transition to in_progress
- All tickets must have clear acceptance criteria

## Domain Model Overview

### Core Aggregates

#### Project (Aggregate Root)
The top-level container for all development work, maintaining configuration and tracking overall progress.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Manage project configuration and metadata
- Contain and organize tickets and epics
- Track contributors and their roles
- Enforce project-level constraints

#### Ticket
The fundamental unit of work, representing a discrete development task with clear scope and acceptance criteria.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Track work status and progress
- Manage dependencies with other tickets
- Store implementation plans and designs
- Record assignment and ownership

#### Epic
A collection of related tickets that together deliver significant business value.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Group related tickets
- Track aggregate progress
- Define high-level success criteria
- Manage epic-level dependencies

### Key Entities

#### User
Human participants in the development process with specific roles and permissions.

**Roles**:
- Developer: Can be assigned tickets, update status
- Project Manager: Can create epics, manage priorities
- Stakeholder: Can view progress, add comments
- Administrator: Full project configuration access

#### Implementation Plan
Technical approach documentation for tickets, enabling pre-implementation review.

**Components**:
- Design proposal
- Technical approach
- Alternative solutions considered
- Risk assessment

### Value Objects

#### Status
- `pending`: Not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently being worked on
- `completed`: Work finished successfully
- `archived`: No longer active

#### Priority
- `high`: Critical path or blocking work
- `medium`: Important but not blocking
- `low`: Nice-to-have or future consideration

#### TicketType
- `feature`: New functionality
- `bug`: Defect fix
- `task`: Technical work
- `research`: Investigation or spike
- `design`: Architecture or design work
- `chore`: Maintenance or tooling

## Key Workflows

### Ticket Creation Workflow
1. User creates ticket with required fields
2. System validates ticket data
3. System assigns unique ID
4. System checks project constraints
5. Ticket added to project
6. Creation event emitted

### Ticket Assignment Workflow
1. Check assignee availability (no other in_progress tickets)
2. Validate assignee permissions
3. Update ticket assignment
4. Notify assignee
5. Update project metrics

### Status Transition Workflow
1. Validate transition rules
2. Check dependency satisfaction
3. Update ticket status
4. Update related epic progress
5. Emit status change event

### Epic Progress Calculation
1. Aggregate all ticket statuses within epic
2. Calculate completion percentage
3. Update epic status based on thresholds
4. Notify stakeholders of milestones

## Integration Points

### Inbound Integrations
- **From AI Integration Context**:
  - Ticket status updates from AI work
  - Implementation plan validations
  - AI-generated design proposals

- **From External Sync Context**:
  - External ticket updates
  - New tickets from external systems
  - Status synchronization

### Outbound Integrations
- **To AI Integration Context**:
  - Tickets for AI assignment
  - Implementation plans for validation
  - Context for AI decision making

- **To External Sync Context**:
  - Tickets marked for external sharing
  - Project configuration
  - Status updates

### Events Published
- `TicketCreated`
- `TicketUpdated`
- `TicketCompleted`
- `EpicCreated`
- `EpicCompleted`
- `ProjectConfigured`

### Events Consumed
- `AIWorkCompleted` (from AI Integration)
- `ExternalTicketUpdated` (from External Sync)
- `ValidationCompleted` (from AI Integration)

## Data Storage

### Persistence Strategy
- File-based storage using JSON
- One file per project containing all project data
- Separate index file for cross-project queries
- Event log for audit trail

### Data Structure Example
```json
{
  "project": {
    "id": "proj_123",
    "name": "Project Manager",
    "config": {},
    "tickets": [],
    "epics": [],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Ticket creation: < 100ms
- Status updates: < 50ms
- Epic progress calculation: < 200ms
- Support 10,000+ tickets per project

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through project sharding
- Efficient indexing for large ticket counts
- Pagination for list operations

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail for all modifications
- Data encryption at rest
- Input validation and sanitization

## Team Ownership

**Responsible Team**: Core Platform Team

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Domain model evolution
- API design and maintenance
- Performance optimization
- Integration contract management

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Advanced search and filtering
- Ticket templates and automation
- Custom fields and workflows
- Batch operations support

### Potential Challenges
- Large project performance optimization
- Complex dependency graph resolution
- Real-time collaboration features
- Migration from current file-based storage
