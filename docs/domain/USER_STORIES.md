## User Stories

### Context Management

**US-001**: As an AI-driven developer, I want to create issues with full context so that AI assistants understand the complete picture when I return to a task.
- **Given** I'm starting a new feature
- **When** I create an issue with background and goals
- **Then** Any AI assistant can understand the context

**US-002**: As an AI assistant, I want to access project history and current state so that I can provide relevant help without losing track of objectives.
- **Given** A developer asks for help
- **When** I query the project state
- **Then** I receive current issues, priorities, and context

### Implementation Planning

**US-003**: As a developer, I want to document implementation plans before coding so that I can get feedback from teammates and AI.
- **Given** I have a complex feature to implement
- **When** I create a design proposal
- **Then** Others can review and suggest improvements

**US-004**: As a tech lead, I want to review implementation approaches before work begins so that we avoid costly mistakes.
- **Given** A team member proposes an implementation
- **When** I access the proposal
- **Then** I can provide feedback before coding starts

### Multi-AI Collaboration

**US-005**: As a developer, I want different AI assistants to share context so that I can leverage each AI's strengths.
- **Given** I'm using Claude for architecture and Gemini for optimization
- **When** I switch between assistants
- **Then** Both have access to the same project context

**US-006**: As an AI assistant, I want to see what other AIs have contributed so that I can build on their work.
- **Given** Another AI has worked on the project
- **When** I access the project
- **Then** I can see previous AI contributions and decisions

### Issue Lifecycle

**US-007**: As a developer, I want to track issue progress so that I know what's been done and what's pending.
- **Given** I have multiple issues in progress
- **When** I check project status
- **Then** I see clear progress indicators

**US-008**: As a developer, I want to organize issues into epics and milestones so that I can manage larger initiatives.
- **Given** I'm working on a major feature
- **When** I create related issues
- **Then** I can group them meaningfully

### External Integration

**US-009**: As an OSS contributor, I want to sync local issues with GitHub Issues so that I can work offline and share selectively.
- **Given** I have local implementation plans
- **When** I'm ready to share publicly
- **Then** I can push selected issues to GitHub

**US-010**: As a team member, I want to pull issues from Jira/Linear so that I can work locally with full context.
- **Given** My team uses external tools
- **When** I start local development
- **Then** I can import relevant issues

### AI Resource Management (Optional)

Optional stories addressing token limits, rate limits, and budget constraints when working with AI assistants.

**US-011**: As a developer using AI assistants, I want visibility into resource usage so that I can manage token limits and costs.
- **Given** I'm working with AI assistants
- **When** I approach token or rate limits
- **Then** I can see usage and adjust my approach

**US-012**: As a developer, I want the system to optimize context for AI models so that essential information fits within token limits.
- **Given** My project context exceeds model limits
- **When** I request AI assistance
- **Then** The most relevant context is prioritized

**US-013**: As a team lead, I want to allocate AI resources across multiple projects so that teams can work efficiently within budgets.
- **Given** Multiple projects using AI assistants
- **When** Resources are limited
- **Then** I can prioritize and allocate fairly
