# TEST STRATEGY

> **Note**: This document contains detailed testing specifications. For contributor testing guidelines and setup instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Overview

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Project Manager system, integrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices with AI-assisted development workflows.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Ensure reliability of local-first architecture
- Validate AI integration and MCP server functionality
- Verify external system synchronization
- Maintain high code quality and coverage
- Support continuous integration and deployment

## 2.1. Current Testing Status

**Overall Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with high success rate across all packages

**Test Distribution by Layer**:

- **Domain Layer**: Comprehensive unit tests for entities, value objects, and business logic
- **Application Layer**: Use case testing with repository mocking
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations and data mapping tests
- **SDK Layer**: Facade pattern and dependency injection validation
- **CLI Layer**: Command interface and user input validation
- **MCP Server Layer**: AI integration tools and protocol compliance

**Testing Approach**: Following t-wada (Takuto Wada) methodology:

- Boundary value testing for all input validation
- Error case coverage for exception scenarios
- Edge case testing for data limits and special characters
- Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies

## 3. Test Levels and Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and modules

**Coverage Target**: High coverage for core business logic with quality focus

**Technology Stack**:

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework
- **Mock Functions**: vi.fn() for dependency isolation
- **Test Doubles**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies

**Test Categories**:

- **Domain model validation**: Entity and value object behavior
- **Business logic verification**: Use case execution and workflow
- **Utility function testing**: Helper functions and data transformation
- **Error handling scenarios**: Exception throwing and graceful failure
- **Boundary value testing**: Input limits and edge cases
- **Integration testing**: Layer interactions and dependency injection

**Implemented Test Examples**:

- `TicketStatus` - Comprehensive status transitions and validation testing
- `TicketMapper` - Domain/persistence data conversion testing
- `CLI Commands` - Create/update/delete operations with error handling
- `ProjectManagerSDK` - Facade pattern and API operations testing
- `UseCaseFactoryProvider` - Dependency injection pattern validation

**Example Test Structure**:

```typescript
describe('TicketManager', () => {
  describe('createTicket', () => {
    it('should create a valid ticket with required fields', () => {
      // Arrange
      const ticketData = {
        title: 'Test Ticket',
        description: 'Test Description',
        priority: 'high'
      };

      // Act
      const ticket = ticketManager.createTicket(ticketData);

      // Assert
      expect(ticket).toBeDefined();
      expect(ticket.id).toBeTruthy();
      expect(ticket.status).toBe('pending');
    });
  });
});
```

### 3.2. Integration Testing

**Scope**: Component interactions and API endpoints

**Current Implementation**: Integration testing is implemented through repository integration tests and cross-layer component testing.

**Test Categories**:

- **Repository Integration**: Testing repository implementations with actual data persistence
- **Use Case Integration**: Testing complete use case workflows with real dependencies
- **SDK Integration**: Testing the SDK facade with underlying application layer
- **CLI Integration**: Testing CLI commands with service layer integration
- **MCP Server Integration**: Testing AI integration tools with protocol compliance

**Examples**:

- Repository tests using real file system operations
- Use case tests with dependency injection containers
- End-to-end command execution testing

### 3.3. End-to-End Testing

**Scope**: Full system workflows and user interactions

**Current Approach**: E2E testing is implemented through CLI command testing and full workflow validation.

**Test Categories**:

- **CLI Workflow Testing**: Full command execution from input to output
- **MCP Server Workflow Testing**: Complete AI integration scenarios
- **File System Integration**: Testing persistence across complete workflows
- **Configuration Integration**: Testing XDG-compliant configuration handling

**Future Considerations**:

- Automated user scenario testing for complex multi-step workflows
- Cross-application integration testing (CLI + MCP Server)
- Performance testing under realistic usage patterns

### 3.4. Dogfooding Testing

**Scope**: Using the project manager system to manage its own development

**Purpose**: Validate real-world usage patterns and identify usability issues through self-hosted development workflows

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Use project-manager to track its own development issues
- Create tickets for new features, bugs, and improvements
- Utilize AI integration features during development
- Exercise all CLI commands and workflows in actual development
- Document pain points and improvement opportunities

**Test Categories**:

- **Self-Management**: Using the system to manage project-manager development
- **AI Workflow Integration**: Testing AI-assisted development through actual usage
- **CLI Usability**: Validating command-line interface through daily use
- **Cross-cutting Features**: Testing comments, attachments, labels, and relationships in real scenarios
- **Performance Under Load**: Handling increasing ticket volumes over time

**Validation Criteria**:

- All core features used successfully in self-development
- Development productivity improvements demonstrated
- AI integration enhances actual development workflows
- CLI commands provide efficient development experience
- Issues identified and resolved through self-use

**Benefits**:

- Authentic user experience validation
- Early detection of usability issues
- Continuous improvement through real-world usage
- Team alignment on product value
- Quality assurance through practical application

**Implementation Guide**: See [Dogfooding Workflow Guide](./dogfooding-workflow.md) for detailed practical steps using development aliases and CLI commands.
