# TEST STRATEGY

> **Note**: This document contains detailed testing specifications. For contributor testing guidelines and setup instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Overview

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Project Manager system, integrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices with AI-assisted development workflows.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Ensure reliability of local-first architecture
- Validate AI integration and MCP server functionality
- Verify external system synchronization
- Maintain high code quality and coverage
- Support continuous integration and deployment

## 3. Test Levels and Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and modules

**Coverage Target**: 90%+ for core business logic

**Technology Stack**:

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework

**Test Categories**:

- Domain model validation
- Business logic verification
- Utility function testing
- Error handling scenarios

**Example Test Structure**:

```typescript
describe('TicketManager', () => {
  describe('createTicket', () => {
    it('should create a valid ticket with required fields', () => {
      // Arrange
      const ticketData = {
        title: 'Test Ticket',
        description: 'Test Description',
        priority: 'high'
      };

      // Act
      const ticket = ticketManager.createTicket(ticketData);

      // Assert
      expect(ticket).toBeDefined();
      expect(ticket.id).toBeTruthy();
      expect(ticket.status).toBe('pending');
    });
  });
});
```

### 3.2. Integration Testing

**Scope**: Component interactions and API endpoints

> TODO: Define integration test scenarios based on system architecture
> Not sure how to implement integration tests yet.

### 3.3. End-to-End Testing

**Scope**: Full system workflows and user interactions

> TODO: Define E2E test scenarios based on user stories
> Not sure how to implement E2E tests yet.

### 3.4. Dogfooding Testing

**Scope**: Using the project manager system to manage its own development

**Purpose**: Validate real-world usage patterns and identify usability issues through self-hosted development workflows

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Use project-manager to track its own development issues
- Create tickets for new features, bugs, and improvements
- Utilize AI integration features during development
- Exercise all CLI commands and workflows in actual development
- Document pain points and improvement opportunities

**Test Categories**:

- **Self-Management**: Using the system to manage project-manager development
- **AI Workflow Integration**: Testing AI-assisted development through actual usage
- **CLI Usability**: Validating command-line interface through daily use
- **Cross-cutting Features**: Testing comments, attachments, labels, and relationships in real scenarios
- **Performance Under Load**: Handling increasing ticket volumes over time

**Validation Criteria**:

- All core features used successfully in self-development
- Development productivity improvements demonstrated
- AI integration enhances actual development workflows
- CLI commands provide efficient development experience
- Issues identified and resolved through self-use

**Benefits**:

- Authentic user experience validation
- Early detection of usability issues
- Continuous improvement through real-world usage
- Team alignment on product value
- Quality assurance through practical application

**Implementation Guide**: See [Dogfooding Workflow Guide](./dogfooding-workflow.md) for detailed practical steps using development aliases and CLI commands.
