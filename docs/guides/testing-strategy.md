# TEST STRATEGY

> **Note**: This document contains detailed testing specifications. For contributor testing guidelines and setup instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Overview

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Project Manager system, integrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices with AI-assisted development workflows.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Ensure reliability of local-first architecture
- Validate AI integration and MCP server functionality
- Verify external system synchronization
- Maintain high code quality and coverage
- Support continuous integration and deployment

## 3. Test Levels and Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and modules

**Coverage Target**: 90%+ for core business logic

**Technology Stack**:

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework

**Test Categories**:

- Domain model validation
- Business logic verification
- Utility function testing
- Error handling scenarios

**Example Test Structure**:

```typescript
describe('TicketManager', () => {
  describe('createTicket', () => {
    it('should create a valid ticket with required fields', () => {
      // Arrange
      const ticketData = {
        title: 'Test Ticket',
        description: 'Test Description',
        priority: 'high'
      };

      // Act
      const ticket = ticketManager.createTicket(ticketData);

      // Assert
      expect(ticket).toBeDefined();
      expect(ticket.id).toBeTruthy();
      expect(ticket.status).toBe('pending');
    });
  });
});
```

### 3.2. Integration Testing

**Scope**: Component interactions and API endpoints

> TODO: Define integration test scenarios based on system architecture
> Not sure how to implement integration tests yet.

### 3.3. End-to-End Testing

**Scope**: Full system workflows and user interactions

> TODO: Define E2E test scenarios based on user stories
> Not sure how to implement E2E tests yet.

## 4. Test Environment Setup

### 4.1. Local Development

**Requirements**:

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm package manager

### 4.2. Continuous Integration

**Pipeline Configuration**:

- Run tests on every commit
- Parallel test execution
- Coverage reporting
- Test result artifacts
