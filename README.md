# [TBD] Project Manager

A local-first ticket management system designed for AI-driven development, enabling seamless collaboration between developers and multiple AI assistants while supporting native language development workflows.

## What is Project Manager?

Project Manager is an open-source tool that enables effective collaboration between developers and AI assistants through issue-based development:

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains shared understanding across human developers and multiple AI systems
- **Shift-Left Development**: Promotes early quality assurance through issue-based workflows and pre-implementation reviews
- **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Enables different AI systems (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to work from the same project context
- **Implementation Planning**: Documents and validates technical approaches before coding begins
- **External Integration**: Syncs with GitHub Issues, Jira, and other project management tools

## Key Features

### Current

- Local ticket, epic, and roadmap management
- CLI interface for developer productivity
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI integration
- Language-aware workflows (local native language, remote project language)
- AI-powered language bridging (through MCP and integrated AI services)

### Planned

- Multi-AI collaboration protocols
- External ticket system synchronization (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
- Implementation plan templates and review workflows
- Project milestone and priority visualization
- Native language workflow support (translation capabilities through AI integration, not built-in)

## Target Users

- **AI-Driven Developers**: Those using AI assistants as primary development partners
- **International Engineers**: Engineers working in foreign companies who want to focus on engineering without language barriers
- **OSS Contributors**: Non-English native speakers contributing to international open source projects
- **Distributed Teams**: Teams needing to coordinate between multiple AI systems and human developers
- **Engineering Teams**: Teams wanting to leverage their native language for better problem-solving while maintaining project standards
