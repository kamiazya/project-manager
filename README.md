# [TBD] Project Manager

A local-first ticket management system designed for AI-driven development, enabling seamless collaboration between developers and multiple AI assistants while supporting native language development workflows.

## What is Project Manager

Project Manager is an open-source tool that enables effective collaboration between developers and AI assistants through issue-based development:

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains shared understanding across human developers and multiple AI systems
- **Shift-Left Development**: Promotes early quality assurance through issue-based workflows and pre-implementation reviews
- **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Enables different AI systems (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to work from the same project context
- **Implementation Planning**: Documents and validates technical approaches before coding begins
- **External Integration**: Syncs with GitHub Issues, Jira, and other project management tools

## Key Features

### Current

- âœ… Local ticket management (CRUD operations)
- âœ… CLI for developer productivity
- âœ… MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI integration
  - Ticket management tools
  - Project configuration management
  - Hot reload development mode
- âœ… Project configuration management
- Language-aware workflows (local native language, remote project language)
- AI-powered language bridging (through MCP and integrated AI services)

### Planned

- ðŸ”„ Epic and roadmap management
- ðŸ”„ Multi-AI collaboration protocols
- ðŸ”„ External ticket system synchronization (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Implementation plan templates and review workflows
- ðŸ”„ Project milestone and priority visualization
- ðŸ”„ Native language workflow support (translation capabilities through AI integration, not built-in)

## Target Users

- **AI-Driven Developers**: Those using AI assistants as primary development partners
- **International Engineers**: Engineers working in foreign companies who want to focus on engineering without language barriers
- **OSS Contributors**: Non-English native speakers contributing to international open source projects
- **Distributed Teams**: Teams needing to coordinate between multiple AI systems and human developers
- **Engineering Teams**: Teams wanting to leverage their native language for better problem-solving while maintaining project standards

## Quick Start

### Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a new ticket
pnpm pm new "Fix login bug" -d "Users cannot login with email" -p h

# List tickets
pnpm pm todo

# Start working on a ticket
pnpm pm start <ticket-id>

# Complete a ticket
pnpm pm done <ticket-id>
```

### MCP Server for AI Integration

```bash
# Start MCP server for AI integration

# Unix/Linux/macOS
NODE_ENV=development pm --mcp  # Development mode with hot reload

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set NODE_ENV=development && pm --mcp

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NODE_ENV="development"; pm --mcp

# Cross-platform (using cross-env - recommended)
npx cross-env NODE_ENV=development pm --mcp

# Production mode (all platforms)
pm --mcp

# Or from the MCP server package
cd packages/mcp-server
pnpm dev                       # Development mode
pnpm build && node dist/bin/mcp-server.js  # Production mode
```

The MCP server provides 9 tools for AI integration:

- Ticket management (create, read, update, search, stats)
- Project configuration management
- Project information retrieval

See [MCP Server README](./packages/mcp-server/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.
