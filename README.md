# Project Manager

A local-first ticket management system designed for AI-driven development, enabling seamless collaboration between developers and multiple AI assistants while supporting native language development workflows.

## What is Project Manager

Project Manager is an open-source tool that enables effective collaboration between developers and AI assistants through issue-based development:

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains shared understanding across human developers and multiple AI systems
- **Shift-Left Development**: Promotes early quality assurance through issue-based workflows and pre-implementation reviews
- **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Enables different AI systems (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to work from the same project context
- **Implementation Planning**: Documents and validates technical approaches before coding begins
- **External Integration**: Syncs with GitHub Issues, Jira, and other project management tools

## Quick Start

> **Note**: This guide covers development installation from source.
> For production use, see the installation options below.

### Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kamiazya/project-manager.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a new ticket
pnpm pm create "Fix login bug" -d "Users cannot login with email" -p h
```

### SDK Usage (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { createProjectManagerSDK } from '@project-manager/sdk'

// Create SDK instance
const sdk = await createProjectManagerSDK()

// Create tickets
const ticket = await sdk.tickets.create({
  title: 'Implement user authentication',
  description: 'Add JWT-based authentication',
  priority: 'high',
  type: 'feature'
})

// Get ticket by ID
const foundTicket = await sdk.tickets.getById(ticket.id)

// Update ticket content
const updatedTicket = await sdk.tickets.updateContent({
  id: ticket.id,
  title: 'Updated title',
  description: 'Updated description'
})

// Update ticket status
await sdk.tickets.updateStatus(ticket.id, 'in_progress')

// Search tickets
const results = await sdk.tickets.search({
  query: 'authentication',
  status: 'in_progress',
  priority: 'high'
})

// Delete ticket
await sdk.tickets.delete(ticket.id)

// Environment operations
const currentEnv = sdk.environment.getEnvironment()
const isDev = sdk.environment.isDevelopmentLike()

// Development process (only in development-like environments)
if (sdk.development.isAvailable()) {
  const processService = sdk.development.getProcessService()
}
```

### MCP Server for AI Integration

```bash
# Start MCP server (from monorepo root)
pnpm pm-mcp-server             # Development mode with hot reload
NODE_ENV=production pnpm pm-mcp-server  # Production mode

# Or run directly from apps directory
cd apps/mcp-server
pnpm dev                       # Development mode
pnpm build && node dist/bin/mcp-server.js  # Production mode
```

The MCP server provides comprehensive tools for AI integration:

- Ticket management (create, read, update, search, stats)
- Project configuration management
- Project information retrieval

See [MCP Server README](./apps/mcp-server/README.md) for detailed AI integration instructions.

## Project Structure

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                    # Applications (final deliverables)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli/                 # CLI application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mcp-server/          # MCP server for AI integration
â””â”€â”€ packages/                # Libraries and shared code
    â”œâ”€â”€ base/                # Foundation package (configuration, types)
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain/              # Domain layer (entities, value objects)
    â”œâ”€â”€ application/         # Application layer (use cases, interfaces)
    â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/      # Infrastructure layer (repositories, adapters)
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/                 # TypeScript SDK with Facade pattern
    â””â”€â”€ shared/              # Shared utilities and types
```

### Architecture Layers

- **Domain Layer** (`packages/domain`): Core business logic, entities, and value objects
- **Application Layer** (`packages/application`): Use cases, repository interfaces, and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`packages/infrastructure`): Repository implementations, external adapters
- **SDK Layer** (`packages/sdk`): Unified API facade for external consumers
