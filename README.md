# [TBD] Project Manager

A local-first ticket management system designed for AI-driven development, enabling seamless collaboration between developers and multiple AI assistants while supporting native language development workflows.

## What is Project Manager

Project Manager is an open-source tool that enables effective collaboration between developers and AI assistants through issue-based development:

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains shared understanding across human developers and multiple AI systems
- **Shift-Left Development**: Promotes early quality assurance through issue-based workflows and pre-implementation reviews
- **Multi-AI Collaboration**: Enables different AI systems (Claude, Gemini, etc.) to work from the same project context
- **Implementation Planning**: Documents and validates technical approaches before coding begins
- **External Integration**: Syncs with GitHub Issues, Jira, and other project management tools

## Key Features

### Current

- âœ… **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… **Local ticket management**: Full CRUD operations with Clean Architecture patterns
- âœ… **CLI Application**: Developer-friendly command-line interface (apps/cli)
- âœ… **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI integration (apps/mcp-server)
  - 9 AI integration tools
  - Hot reload development mode
  - Real-time project context sharing
- âœ… **TypeScript SDK**: Facade pattern for unified API access (packages/sdk)
- âœ… **Layered Architecture**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure separation
- âœ… **Dependency Injection**: Inversify-based DI container for Clean Architecture
- âœ… **Project configuration management**: XDG-compliant configuration
- âœ… **Language-aware workflows**: Native language development with AI bridging

### Planned

- ðŸ”„ Epic and roadmap management
- ðŸ”„ Multi-AI collaboration protocols
- ðŸ”„ External ticket system synchronization (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Implementation plan templates and review workflows
- ðŸ”„ Project milestone and priority visualization
- ðŸ”„ Native language workflow support (translation capabilities through AI integration, not built-in)

## Target Users

- **AI-Driven Developers**: Those using AI assistants as primary development partners
- **International Engineers**: Engineers working in foreign companies who want to focus on engineering without language barriers
- **OSS Contributors**: Non-English native speakers contributing to international open source projects
- **Distributed Teams**: Teams needing to coordinate between multiple AI systems and human developers
- **Engineering Teams**: Teams wanting to leverage their native language for better problem-solving while maintaining project standards

- External system integration (GitHub Issues, Jira)
- Advanced AI collaboration

## Quick Start

> **Note**: This project is not published to npm yet.
> So this is not truly a "quick start" guide, but rather a "how to run the project" guide.

### Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kamiazya/project-manager.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a new ticket
pnpm pm new "Fix login bug" -d "Users cannot login with email" -p h

# List tickets
pnpm pm todo

# Start working on a ticket
pnpm pm start <ticket-id>

# Complete a ticket
pnpm pm done <ticket-id>
```

### SDK Usage (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { createProjectManagerSDK } from '@project-manager/sdk'

// Create SDK instance
const sdk = await createProjectManagerSDK({
  storagePath: './my-project-data',
  environment: 'development'
})

// Use the SDK
const ticket = await sdk.tickets.create({
  title: 'Implement user authentication',
  description: 'Add JWT-based authentication',
  priority: 'high',
  type: 'feature'
})

const allTickets = await sdk.tickets.getAll()
const stats = await sdk.tickets.getStats()
```

### MCP Server for AI Integration

```bash
# Start MCP server (from monorepo root)
pnpm pm-mcp-server             # Development mode with hot reload
NODE_ENV=production pnpm pm-mcp-server  # Production mode

# Or run directly from apps directory
cd apps/mcp-server
pnpm dev                       # Development mode
pnpm build && node dist/bin/mcp-server.js  # Production mode
```

The MCP server provides 9 tools for AI integration:

- Ticket management (create, read, update, search, stats)
- Project configuration management
- Project information retrieval

See [MCP Server README](./apps/mcp-server/README.md) for detailed AI integration instructions.

## Project Structure

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                    # Applications (final deliverables)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli/                 # CLI application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mcp-server/          # MCP server for AI integration
â””â”€â”€ packages/                # Libraries and shared code
    â”œâ”€â”€ base/                # Foundation package (configuration, types)
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain/              # Domain layer (entities, value objects)
    â”œâ”€â”€ application/         # Application layer (use cases, interfaces)
    â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/      # Infrastructure layer (repositories, adapters)
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/                 # TypeScript SDK with Facade pattern
    â””â”€â”€ shared/              # Shared utilities and types
```

### Architecture Layers

- **Domain Layer** (`packages/domain`): Core business logic, entities, and value objects
- **Application Layer** (`packages/application`): Use cases, repository interfaces, and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`packages/infrastructure`): Repository implementations, external adapters
- **SDK Layer** (`packages/sdk`): Unified API facade for external consumers
- **Applications** (`apps/`): CLI and MCP server applications using the layered architecture
